 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_system_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * The System driver provides a collection of interfaces between the user
 * application logic, and the core device functionality (such as clocks, reset
 * cause determination, etc.) that is required for all applications. It contains
 * a number of sub-modules that control one specific aspect of the device:
 *
 * - System Core (this module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_clock_group "System Clock Control" (sub-module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_interrupt_group "System Interrupt Control" (sub-module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_pinmux_group "System Pin Multiplexer Control" (sub-module)
 *
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SUPPORT
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vreg Voltage Regulator
 * The SAM device controls the voltage regulators for the core (VDDCORE) and
 * backup (VDDBU) domains. It sets the voltage regulators according to the sleep
 * modes, the performance level, or the user configuration.
 *
 * In active mode, the voltage regulator can be chosen on the fly between a LDO
 * or a Buck converter.In standby mode, the low power voltage regulator is used
 * to supply VDDCORE.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_bbps Battery Backup Power Switch
 * The SAM device supports connection of a battery backup to the VBAT power pin.
 * It includes functionality that enables automatic power switching between main
 * power and battery backup power. This will ensure power to the backup domain,
 * when the main battery or power source is unavailable.
 * \endif
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vref Voltage References
 * The various analog modules within the SAM devices (such as AC, ADC, and
 * DAC) require a voltage reference to be configured to act as a reference point
 * for comparisons and conversions.
 *
 * The SAM devices contain multiple references, including an internal
 * temperature sensor, and a fixed band-gap voltage source. When enabled, the
 * associated voltage reference can be selected within the desired peripheral
 * where applicable.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_reset_cause System Reset Cause
 * In some applications there may be a need to execute a different program
 * flow based on how the device was reset. For example, if the cause of reset
 * was the Watchdog timer (WDT), this might indicate an error in the application
 * and a form of error handling or error logging might be needed.
 *
 * For this reason, an API is provided to retrieve the cause of the last system
 * reset, so that appropriate action can be taken.
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SUPPORT
 * There are three groups of reset sources:
 *   - Power supply reset: Resets caused by an electrical issue. It covers POR and BODs reset.
 *   - User reset: Resets caused by the application. It covers external reset,
 *             system resetrequest and watchdog reset.
 *   - Backup reset: Resets caused by a backup mode exit condition.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_performance_level Performance Level
 * Performance level allows use to adjust the regulator output voltage to reduce
 * power consumption. The user can select on the fly the performance level
 * configuration which best suits its application.
 *
 * The SAM device embeds up to three performance level (PL0, PL1 and PL2).
 * Each performance level defines a maximum frequency and a corresponding
 * consumption in 渭A/MHz,when the application selects a new performance level,
 * the voltage applied on the full logic area moves from a value to another,
 * it can reduce the active consumption while decreasing the maximum frequency
 * of the device.
 *
 * Performance level transition is possible only when the device is in active
 * mode, after a reset, the device starts in the lowest performance level
 * (lowest power consumption and lowest max. frequency). The application can then
 * switch to another performance level at anytime without any stop in the code
 * execution. As shown in \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_performance_level_transition_figure.
 *
 * \note When scaling down the performance level,the bus frequency should be first
 *  scaled down in order to not exceed the maximum frequency allowed for the
 *  low performance level.
 *  When scaling up the performance level (for example from PL0 to PL2), the bus
 *  frequency can be increased only once the performance level transition is
 *  completed,check the performance level status.
 *

 * \image html performance_level_transition.gif "The performance level  transition"
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_power_domain Power Domain Gating
 * Power domain gating  can  turn on or off power domain voltage to save power
 * while keeping other domain powered up. It can be used in standby sleep mode,
 * in standby mode, when power-gated, the internal state of the logic can be
 * retained  allowing the application context to be kept.
 *
 * Power domain can be in three states:
 * - Active state: the power domain is powered on.
 * - Retention state: the main voltage supply for the power domain is switched off, 
 * while maintaining a secondary low-power supply for the sequential cells. The 
 * logic context is restored when waking up.
 * - Off state: the power domain is entirely powered off. The logic context is lost.
 *
 * The SAM L21 device has three power domains: PD0, PD1 and PD2. 
 * - By default, a power domain is set automatically to retention state in standby 
 * sleep mode if no activity is required in it, the application can force all power
 * domains to remain in active state during standby sleep mode in order to accelerate
 * wakeup time.
 * - Static Power_SleepWalking: When entering standby mode, if a peripheral needs to 
 * remain in run mode to perform sleepwalking task, its power domain (PDn) remains in
 * active state as well as the inferior power domains (<PDn).
 * - Dynamic Power_SleepWalking: During standby mode, a power domain (PDn) in active
 * state (using the static Power_SleepWalking principle), can wakeup a superior power
 * domain (>PDn) in order to perform a sleepwalking task. The superior power domain is 
 * then automatically set to active state. At the end of the sleepwalking task, either 
 * the device can be waken-up or the superior power domain can be set again to retention
 * state.
 *
 * Power domains can be linked each other,it allows a power domain (PDn) to be kept
 * in active state if the inferior power domain (PDn-1) is in active state too.
 *
 * The table \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_power_domain_overview_table illustrates the 
 * four cases to consider in standby mode
